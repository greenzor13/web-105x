        Yamato appears to be very laid back, preferring to take a hands-off approach to almost anything. Even his title of Leader was something that was given to him due to being the oldest, rather than something he earned.
        Despite this initial appearance, Yamato is one of the first people to consider the feelings and safety of the other members, usually while completely disregarding his own. He's also stated on multiple occasions that he's willing to take the brunt of any mudslinging directed at IDOLiSH7 as a whole. Yamato is also often chastising other members for taking burdens on their own.
        And yet, despite this, Yamato is generally very distant and avoids talking about his own issues. This comes from two general causes. The rational side of him is terrified of involving IDOLiSH7 in his messy past; he initially wanted to use his growing fame in his revenge scheme, but backed out upon realizing how much he genuinely enjoyed being with everyone. The irrational side of him is terrified of being left alone and unloved when everyone finds out he's an illegitimate child, and eventually acts out on this fear very violently toward Yuki.
        Once aspects of his past are settled and he talks about his feelings with his father, Yamato visibly brightens up, and is generally much more open with everyone.
        Yamato's weakness towards those who are hardworking or earnest comes from his upbringing; he no longer considers himself pure in any sense, and envies and admires those who are. Mitsuki and Riku are the two who get this reaction the most out of him, though he is especially weak to Riku; he has difficulty saying no to Riku's requests, and the other members have used this against him.
