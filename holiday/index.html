        <p>Yamato Nikaido (二階堂 大和にかいどうやまと) comes across as very lazy and easy-going, but he is very passionate about what he does and cares a lot about the other members of IDOLiSH7. He took up the position of “Leader” only because he was the oldest in the group, he actually considered pulling himself out of the audition for IDOLiSH7. <br> 
            <br>Yamato has held a very deep dislike towards the entertainment world in general before joining the agency, And it's implied that he was connected to it himself at some point in the past. <br>
            <br>In regard to how Yamato was scouted, Yamato had already gotten an offer from an acquaintance who was quite persistent, but then Otoharu Takanashi appeared and under the guise of the person’s backer, convinced Yamato to join Takanashi Production instead. Yamato describes it as a scenario where he refers to himself as the girlfriend, and the wing-man (Otoharu) ends up stealing the girlfriend instead of supporting the guy.

        <h4 id="funkyText">Personality</h4>
        <p>Yamato appears to be very laid back, preferring to take a hands-off approach to almost anything. Even his title of Leader was something that was given to him due to being the oldest, rather than something he earned.
            <br><br>
            Despite this initial appearance, Yamato is one of the first people to consider the feelings and safety of the other members, usually while completely disregarding his own. He’s also stated on multiple occasions that he’s willing to take the brunt of any mudslinging directed at IDOLiSH7 as a whole. Yamato is also often chastising other members for taking burdens on their own.
            <br><br>And yet, despite this, Yamato is generally very distant and avoids talking about his own issues. This comes from two general causes. The rational side of him is terrified of involving IDOLiSH7 in his messy past; he initially wanted to use his growing fame in his revenge scheme, but backed out upon realizing how much he genuinely enjoyed being with everyone. The irrational side of him is terrified of being left alone and unloved when everyone finds out he’s an illegitimate child, and eventually acts out on this fear very violently toward Yuki.
            <br><br>
            Once aspects of his past are settled and he talks about his feelings with his father, Yamato visibly brightens up, and is generally much more open with everyone.
            <br><br>
            Yamato’s weakness towards those who are hardworking or earnest comes from his upbringing; he no longer considers himself pure in any sense, and envies and admires those who are. Mitsuki and Riku are the two who get this reaction the most out of him, though he is especially weak to Riku; he has difficulty saying no to Riku’s requests, and the other members have used this against him.

        <h4 id="funkyText">History</h4>
        <p>
            Yamato grew up in what he describes as a very loving family, and was often spoiled as a child. Unfortunately, this image was utterly shattered when he found his father, famous actor Chiba Shizuo, on TV with his true wife. The house of his mother, Chiba’s mistress, was used as the physical location for the “Chiba Salon”, a group of well-connected actors and performers who protected each other’s dirty secrets. As a result of both this environment and the truth behind his father, Yamato grew up disillusioned with the entertainment industry and decided to plot his revenge to reveal the truth of the Salon. He also met  Yuki when he was still in high school. Yamato was scouted by accident; Otoharu came in under the airs of helping someone who kept scouting Yamato, but Otoharu ended up putting forth his own offer instead, which Yamato accepted.
