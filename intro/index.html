    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <h3>Comics</h3>

    <h2>Anime</h2>
    <h3>Watching</h3>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>

    <p>I really enjoy watching anime, and cartoons from both the US and other countries. I enjoy seeing they different stories, art styles, and interpretations of ideas. I particularly enjoy anime's with a lot of thought put into them that you can analyze and compare.</p>

    <h2>Cosplay</h2>
    <h3>Creating</h3>
    <h3>Going to conventions</h3>

    <p>I also enjoy going to conventions, and seeing all of the amazing cosplays people have worked hard to put together. I like wearing my own costumes and meeting new people, and seeing old friends. Panels are also a joy to attend, especially when I learn new things or get to play fun games.</p>

    <p>I am taking this class if not only bacue I need to for my art certificate. Although it could also be considered benificial to me considering I intento to attampt to make more games in the future, where of course coding is an important aspect to know. I also intend to work on a website for my art, comics, and stuff in general to all be accessed in one place. <br> I mean my dad intends to help me with that, but knowing him I cant rely on him to do it all, not only because that would be sort of lazy of me but also because he just won't.</p>
